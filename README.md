Basic:

1. **Reverse a String**: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

2. **Palindrome Checker**: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), false otherwise.

3. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Write a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

4. **Factorial Calculation**: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

5. **Prime Number Checker**: Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns true if the number is prime, false otherwise.

Advanced:

1. **Anagram Checker**: Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns true if the two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in a different order), false otherwise.

2. **FizzBuzz**: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

3. **Binary Search**: Write a function that implements the binary search algorithm to find a target number in a sorted array. The function should return the index of the target number if found, or -1 if the target number is not in the array.

4. **Reverse a Linked List**: Write a function that takes the head of a singly linked list and returns the same list reversed.

5. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**: Write a function that takes two sorted arrays as input and returns a single sorted array that contains all the elements from both input arrays.

Go Routines:

1. **Concurrent Factorial Calculation**: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using Goroutines. Each Goroutine should calculate a part of the factorial, and the main Goroutine should combine the results to get the final factorial.

2. **Parallel Matrix Multiplication**: Write a program that multiplies two matrices using Goroutines. Split the work of multiplying rows of the first matrix by columns of the second matrix among multiple Goroutines to speed up the multiplication process.

3. **Concurrent Prime Number Checker**: Write a program that checks if a given number is prime using Goroutines. Each Goroutine should check a range of numbers, and the main Goroutine should combine the results to determine if the number is prime.

4. **Concurrent File Processing**: Write a program that reads a large file and processes its contents concurrently using Goroutines. For example, you could count the number of occurrences of each word in the file using multiple Goroutines.

5. **Concurrent Web Requests**: Write a program that makes multiple HTTP requests to different URLs concurrently using Goroutines. Combine the results of the requests to perform some analysis or processing.
